ðŸ’™ Operating and overseeing a Minecraft gameserver

## Progress evaluation

Momentarily, I am contributing to the workflow of the CCC, maintaining an alliance with Digitalcourage.

A long-term project I lay my eyes on will be a multiplayer roleplay gameserver.
The infrastructure and functions within Minecraft itself will widely be based on Java and MySQL.
For the communication during roleplay (server) activity, a Discord server will be used.
