Devtill2yeah- about me

Hello fellows, mostly I am enganged in cyber security and anonymity measures,
for that purpose to archieve I mostly am scripting using Batch files. 
As for that, database systems almost are mandatory, I currfently am gettng familiar with managing databse tools. 

In addition I currently am working on a Minecraft multiplayer Roleplay server, 
in whichÂ´s the building of the castle is coordinated. 
Specifically, the RP and the game itself runs in a JAVA environment and will be
coordinated using a Discord server set up for purposes of communication as well as interaction.
