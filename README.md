# Nice to have you here


About me:

Currently, I am contributing to the workflow of CCC, maintaining an alliance with Digitalcourage.

Projects I work on:

- threat analysis using reverse engeneering as well as ethical hacking partially. 
- Operating and overseeing a Minecraft-gameserver

The second project mentioned will be a multiplayer roleplay server.
This roleplay-gameserver and the environment itself are widely based on Java and MySQL. 
To let roleplay happen successfully, we will be using a Discord server set up for the interaction during sessions of roleplaying. 


Tools and languages I use more or less frequent are 

-> Javascript
-> Java
-> MySQL
-> Python
-> HTML
-> Batch 
-> PHP
