# Nice to have you here


ðŸ‘€ threat analysis using reverse engeneering

ðŸ’­ ethical hacking

ðŸ©µ Operating and overseeing a Minecraft-gameserver

ðŸ§  learning as much as there's possible about systems of encryption 

Momentarily, I am contributing to the workflow of CCC, maintaining an alliance with Digitalcourage.

The second project mentioned will be a multiplayer roleplay server.
This roleplay-gameserver and the environment itself are widely based on Java and MySQL. 
To let roleplay happen successfully, we will be using a Discord server set up for the interaction during sessions of roleplaying. 


Tools and languages I use more or less frequent are 

-> Javascript

-> Java

-> MySQL

-> Python

-> HTML

-> Batch

-> PHP
