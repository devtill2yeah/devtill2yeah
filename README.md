## Progress evaluation

Momentarily, I am contributing to the workflow of Digitalcourage while maintaining close alliance with the CCC.

A long-term project I lay my eyes on will be the administration and maintenance of a multiplayer roleplay gameserver.
The infrastructure and functions within Minecraft itself will widely be based on Java and MySQL.
For the communication during roleplay (and server) activity, a Discord server will be used.
