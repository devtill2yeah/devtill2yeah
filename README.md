## Progress evaluation

Momentarily, I am contributing to the workflow of CCC, maintaining an alliance with Digitalcourage.

A long-term project I lay my eyes on will be a multiplayer roleplay server.
This roleplay-gameserver and the environment itself are widely based on Java and MySQL.
For the communication during roleplay (server) activity, a Discord server will be used.

## Tools and languages I use more or less frequent

-> Javascript

-> Java

-> MySQL

-> Python

-> HTML

-> Batch

-> PHP
